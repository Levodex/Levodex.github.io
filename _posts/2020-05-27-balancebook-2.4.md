Greetings!
I hope you are doing safe in these tough times.
This pandemic situation has caused some delays but the major planned update for BalanceBook is finally available on the Play Store. 

Version 2.4.9 brings two new features and several performance improvements. Data backup & restoration is now available. Backup files can be browsed from the restore menu or directly opened through the File Manager apps on your device (May not be compatible with every File Manager). The internet permission(s) have also been removed & various speed optimizations have been added.
 
Please update ASAP since upcoming security updates will not be compatible with versions 2.3 and below.

Check it out and let me know your feedback,
Thanks.
